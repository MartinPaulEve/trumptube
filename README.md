# TrumpTube

A proof-of-concept experiment to pull out comments on YouTube video surrounding the 2016 Presidential election in the United States.

# Setup
The rapid prototype here runs on Flask. Put your YouTube credentials (simple API key) in a file called credentials.txt in the importers/youtube/ folder. Put the video IDs of the videos you want to harvest in sources.txt, one per line. Visualization is done by copying a CSV file into the staic folder.
